don't understand the God who'd let us meet if we could never be together.
When they ask me what I liked the best,I'll tell them "It was you".
I would rather have had one breath of her hair,
one kiss of her mouth,one touch of her hand than an eternity without it.
I have a feeling there's something bigger out there.
Bigger than we and bigger than you.
I wait all day just hoping for one more minute with you
